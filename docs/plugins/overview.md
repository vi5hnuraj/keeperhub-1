# Plugins

Plugins provide the actions available in your workflows. Each plugin adds one or more actions that you can drag onto the workflow canvas and configure.

## How Plugins Work

1. **Add an action** -- Drag a plugin action from the action panel onto your workflow canvas
2. **Configure inputs** -- Set parameters in the right-side panel. Use `{{NodeName.field}}` to reference outputs from previous steps
3. **Connect nodes** -- Wire the action into your workflow flow using edges
4. **Run** -- Execute the workflow. Each action runs in sequence following the edges

## Plugin Categories

### Blockchain (Web3)

Core on-chain operations: reading balances, calling smart contracts, transferring tokens, and security analysis. Read-only actions work without a wallet. Write actions require a connected Turnkey wallet.

### Code

Execute custom JavaScript in a sandboxed VM environment with access to workflow data via template variables. Use for data transformation, aggregation, external API calls, and complex conditional logic. No credentials required.

### Math

Pure computation nodes for aggregating numeric values from upstream nodes. Supports sum, count, average, median, min, max, and product operations with optional post-aggregation arithmetic. Automatically handles large integers using BigInt arithmetic to preserve precision.

### Security

Security-focused actions for transaction analysis, risk assessment, and Safe multisig monitoring. These actions use `maxRetries = 0` (fail-safe behavior) to ensure errors block execution rather than silently retrying.

### Notifications

Send alerts and messages through Discord, Slack, Telegram, email, PagerDuty and webhooks. Typically used as the final step in monitoring workflows to notify your team when conditions are met. PagerDuty differs from the rest: it opens an incident that someone is paged for and that the workflow can resolve again, rather than posting a message.

### Integrations

Connect to external services via webhooks and HTTP requests. Use these to trigger external systems, update dashboards, or integrate with third-party tools.
